--- 40 bb RFIs ---

BTN  = offsuit 8s/7s, suited 5s/4s, off aces and pockets
^^^ dont go tighter than this range, but can go wider

CO  = Offsuit 9s, suited 6s, A5o is bottom of the range, K8o is the bottom of the range

HJ  = Off 10, suited 7s, A7o sometimes, K9o mostly, 86s sometimes, all pockets

LJ = off 10s (QT and J10 sometimes), suited 8s, A9o bottom, no lower than Q7s, A2s bottom on that side

UTG+1 = off jacks, suited 8s higher than 8

UTG = off jacks, suited 9s higher than 9, no QJo

--- against 2.2bb raises in BB ---

vs BTN = off 6s, all suited

vs CO = off 7s, all suited

vs HJ = off 8s, all suited

vs LJ = off 8s, all suited

vs UTG+1 = off 8s, all suited

vs UTG = off 9s, all suited

NOTE: offsuit hands are more sensitive to raise sizing, suited realize much better equity so they aren't as sensitive.

--- against 2.2bb raises in BTN ---

rule of thumb: off 10s, suited 8s > 8, get rid of some off 10s as the PFA gets earlier in position

--- against 2.2bb raises in CO ---

rule of thumb: off Js, suited 9s, take out some jacks are PFR position gets closer to btn / earlier in position

--- against 2.2bb raises in HJ ---

rule of thumb: off Qs, suited 10s, NO MIDDLING SCs,  

continue this pattern to LJ and UTG+1 and stuff just get generally tighter there
